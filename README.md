# Active Directory

## Objective

This Active Directy project aimed to establish a server and create users, aswell as imitate a brute force attack on a Kali machine, a Red Team Attack, & view/read the code on Splunk. The primary focus is to create a virtual server with VMs and create an Active Directory on an admin server. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of creating & controlling a domain, network security, and basic attacks.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of domain concepts and practical application.
- Better understanding in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize basic attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.

### Tools Used

- **Oracle Virtual Box** to host all VMs and allocate memory.
- **Splunk** application and server for log ingestion and analysis aswell as capture and examine network traffic.
- **Powershell** to create telemetry from Atomic Red Team.
- **Atomic Red Team** to apply telemetry and view it in event reader.
- **Kali Linux** to generate a brute force attack with "crowbar" application.
